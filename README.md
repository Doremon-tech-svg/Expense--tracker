Group Ledger — Transparent Group Expense & Debt Tracker

Group Ledger is a web app for tracking shared expenses in groups — friends, trips, roommates, teams, clubs, and more.

Unlike most split apps, this one focuses on:

✅ Accuracy
✅ Transparency
✅ Voting + approvals
✅ Clear records that never disappear

Everything is built step-by-step so beginners can understand and learn.

✨ Features (Current + Planned)
✅ Phase 1 — Basic App

User signup & login

Create and join groups

Simple navigation

✅ Phase 2 — Basic Expenses

Add shared expenses

Equal split among members

See balances (who owes who)

🔄 Phase 3 — Advanced Expenses

Custom split

Multiple payers

Add date, reason, payment method

🔄 Phase 4 — Approvals & Voting

Pending expenses

Approvals from affected members

75% approval for edits/deletes

🔄 Phase 5 — Dashboards

Personal dashboard

Group summaries

Monthly breakdowns

🔄 Phase 6 — Item Catalog

Save reusable items

Faster expense entry

🔄 Phase 7 — Settlements

"Settle up" records

Must be accepted by both parties

No real money movement yet

🎯 Why this exists

Managing group money is usually painful:

✗ nobody remembers who paid
✗ arguments over fairness
✗ mistakes go unnoticed
✗ no clear record

This project solves that by making expenses:

✔ visible
✔ traceable
✔ fair
✔ approval-based

🏗️ Tech Stack (may evolve)

Frontend

React / Next.js

Backend

Node.js (Express or Next API routes)

Database

PostgreSQL (or SQLite during development)

Auth

Email + password (simple first)

Everything is built so beginners can follow along easily.

👨‍💻 Learning Goals

This project is also meant for learning:

how full-stack apps work

how databases store relationships

real expense calculation logic

approvals & voting workflows

writing clean, understandable code

The AI explains every step like a teacher, not like a senior dev talking fast.

🚀 Running the Project (General Idea)

(The AI model will walk through this in detail when building.)

Typical process:

git clone <repo-url>

cd group-ledger

npm install
npm run dev


Then open:

http://localhost:3000


But don’t worry — the AI explains everything during setup.

🛡️ Transparency & Safety Rules

This app is designed so:

✔ Nobody can secretly change records
✔ Major changes require approvals
✔ History is always stored
✔ Settlements must be mutually confirmed

Trust matters.

👏 Final Note

This project is not just an app.
It’s also your learning journey.

Brick by brick.
Feature by feature.

And I’m here to help build it with you. 😊
